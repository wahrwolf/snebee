Heyho,
I need some help with a coding project.
I want to write a server that can do the following:
- receive DNS requests
- hold DHCP like database with hostname, public key, lease time and IP Adresse
- update a wireguard config file

A client should send a DNS lookup request with its own hostname.
The server should lookup the clients hostname and return its ip adress if it exist or generate a new one.
After the database was changed, the server should update the wireguard config file

Can you help me with some skeleton code in python?
